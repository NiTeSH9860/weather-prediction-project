This is a multi-algorithm weather prediction system that uses historical weather data to predict:

1.Temperature (Regression) - Predicting exact temperature values in °C

2.Weather Type (Classification) - Categorizing weather into 6 types (Freezing, Cold, Cool, Mild, Warm, Hot)

The system uses 6 traditional machine learning algorithms plus TensorFlow deep learning for comparison.
